I am pursuing a PhD in Actuarial Science at Université Laval, in Québec (QC, Canada), under the supervision of [Marie-Pier Côté](https://www.fsg.ulaval.ca/corps-professoral/marie-pier-cote) and [Arthur Charpentier](https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org). My thesis, expected for may 2027, is titled "A Causal Perspective on Direct and Indirect Discrimination based on Sensitive Characteristics in Insurance Predictive Models". It is performed in collaboration with one of the largest insurance company in Canada.
